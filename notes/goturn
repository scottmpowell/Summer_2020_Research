(I'm calling the Computer Vision assignment on object tracking Grant's object tracker)
Goturn works by receiving as input the current frame and the previous frame:

Different from Grant's OT because that was only given coordinates and a contour
This means it is not simply looking for a nearby object, but has a reference to the object

"Local object detectors" are comparable to goturn except in cases of occlusion
