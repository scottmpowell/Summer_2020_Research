Face detection vs recognition
detection is simply "there's a face"

Object detection


we will use hard cascade classifier to build a basketball classifier
step 1: find who is in each frame
step 2: find who has the ball



at the end, want to do analysis:
	who passes the ball, who was the star


Need to get images
have images of basketballs and images of nothing in particular
